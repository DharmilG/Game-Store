        When a young street hustler, a retired bank robber, and a terrifying
        psychopath find themselves entangled with some of the most frightening
        and deranged elements of the criminal underworld, the U.S. government,
        and the entertainment industry, they must pull off a series of dangerous
        heists to survive in a ruthless city in which they can trust nobody â€”
        least of all each other.
